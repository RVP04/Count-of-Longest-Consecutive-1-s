# Count of Longest Consecutive 1's
 <p>The program must accept an integer <strong>N</strong> as the input. The program must print the count of longest consecutive 1's in the binary representation of N as the output.</p>

<p><strong>Boundary Condition(s):</strong><br>
1 &lt;= N &lt;= 99999999</p>

<p><strong>Input Format:</strong><br>
The first line contains the integer value of N.</p>

<p><strong>Output Format:</strong><br>
The first line contains the count of longest consecutive 1's in the binary representation of N.</p>

<p><strong>Example Input/Output 1:</strong><br>
Input:<br>
55</p>

<p>Output:<br>
3</p>

<p>Explanation:<br>
The binary representation of 55 is 110111.<br>
The first two bits and the last three bits are consecutive 1's.<br>
The count of the longest consecutive 1's is 3.<br>
Hence, 3 is printed as the output.</p>

<p><strong>Example Input/Output 2:</strong><br>
Input:<br>
1468</p>

<p>Output:<br>
4<br>
